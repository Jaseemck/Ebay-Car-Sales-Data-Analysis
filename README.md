# Exploring Ebay Car Sales Data

In this guided project, we'll work with a dataset of used cars from eBay Kleinanzeigen, a classifieds section of the German eBay website.

The dataset was originally scraped and uploaded to Kaggle. We've made a few modifications from the original dataset that was uploaded to Kaggle:

    * We sampled 50,000 data points from the full dataset, to ensure your code runs quickly in our hosted environment
    * We dirtied the dataset a bit to more closely resemble what you would expect from a scraped dataset (the version uploaded to Kaggle was cleaned to be easier to work with)

The aim of this project is to clean the data and analyze the included used car listings.

## Getting Started

The code can be run on a jupyter notebook. The data are in csv format. App details from both the Google play store and Ios App store are taken.

The dataset used is:
* [Car Sales Data](https://www.kaggle.com/orgesleka/used-cars-database/data)
## Installation

Use the package manager [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install required packages.

####Please make sure to run in the order of the line of codes in you are using a notebook.
